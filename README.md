# Day-2
Today is my second day of learning python wiith help of book named "A Bite of Python".
In this day i have learned about:
1. cycle "while" and "for"
2. Options of the cycles
3. About such thing like "if", "elif", "else"

And that`s all.
Dont think that it was too few information in one day, these themas are huge and hard to learn already but I am realy motivated to improve my skills.

There are my work scripts in the top of repository, so you can see them and maybe comment my mistakes...
